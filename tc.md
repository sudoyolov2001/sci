# TARIFF CALCULATION for Taiba 2 IPP and Qassim 2 IPP (1,800 MW CCGT IPP Each)

## SUMMARY
- Revenue
  - Capital Payment
  - Fixed O&M Payment
  - Fuel Consumption Adjustment Payment
  - Variable O&M Payment
  - Start-up Payments for Power Plant
- Total Revenue

## NPV Calculations
- NPV of Fixed O&M Revenue (at WACC and Disc Rate per ITB)
- NPV of Variable O&M Revenue (at WACC and Disc Rate per ITB)

## Delay Penalties
- Payable to SPCC
  - ICOD Period Delay Penalty
  - PCOD Period Delay Penalty
  - Total Delay Penalties payable to SPCC
- Receivable from EPC
  - Delay LD Payable to Off-taker
  - LDs Paid by EPC in lieu of Revenue Loss Incurred by the Project Company
  - Total Delay Penalties receivable from EPC

## Performance Penalties
- Capacity shortfall Performance Penalty Receivable from EPC
- One-off Performance Penalty Paid by EPC (Equity and Debt)
- Heat Rate shortfall Performance Penalty Receivable from EPC
- One-off Performance Penalty Paid by EPC (Equity and Debt)

## INPUTS
- Period Flags (Construction, Scheduled/Actual Testing Periods, Post APCOD Operations)
- ICOD Delay, PCOD Delay, Delay in Reliability Testing
- Inflation/ Currency Adjustment (US, Local inflation Index, Fuel Price Indexation, Exchange rate adjustment factor)

## TARIFF EXCHANGE RATE ADJUSTMENTS INPUT
- Local and Foreign Tariff Proportion
  - Foreign (USD) Proportion of Tariff
  - Local Proportion of Tariff

## Unavailability Considerations
- Plant unavailability (planned/unplanned, summer/winter, actual/projected)
- Number of Start-ups in each period (by a gas turbine generator unit)

## Power Dispatch Level and Load Factor

## CALCULATIONS
- Tariff Components - Cost Allocation (Foreign and Local Proportion of Tariff)
- Heat Rate Correction Factor - Periodwise
- Net Energy Generation (MWh) - Projected vs. Actual
- Contracted Capacity (without and with Delay)
- Payment Deduction Factor Calculations (Summer/Winter)

## Unavailability (Hours) and Electrical Energy Losses (MWh)
- Projected vs. Actual (Summer/Winter, Planned/Unplanned)

## Power Dispatch Calculations
- Dispatch Level and Load Factor at various Operating Points

## TARIFF RATES
- Power Capacity Charge, Energy Charge (Variable), Start-up Payment

## Indexed Charge Rates
- Capital cost, Fixed O&M, Variable O&M recovery charge rate

## Payments Calculations
- Component-wise (A - capacity, B - Fixed O&M, C - Fuel, D - Variable O&M)
- Total Payment for Power

## Delay LD Calculations
- ICOD and PCOD Period Delay Penalties
- Revenue Loss due to Delay (Recovered from EPC if applicable)

## Inflation Adjustment
- Deductions to the Fixed O&M Payments based on USPI and Deduction Rate

This structured outline encapsulates the complexity of tariff calculations within the financial model of power projects like Taiba 2 IPP and Qassim 2 IPP, highlighting the major components, inputs, and mechanisms involved in determining and adjusting tariffs.
